# Udacity Baking App Project
This the final project on the Udacity Fast Track Android Developer program, it is meant to display a list
of recipes fetched from the Udacity endpoint site.
The main page of the app uses a recylcerview to display the list of recipes and the detail view uses a 
master/detail flow layout to display more details about the recipe the user selected in the main page.
The project uses a Media player (ExoPlayer) to play videos for each step in preparing the said dessert
and for displaying images in the case where the current step has no video attached.
